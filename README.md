This game is more than just for the grades though. It includes numerical state vector updation just like you would do in a real Falcon 9 like rocket.

# Game Context Story:
You are a Niel Marstrong, your vehicle is about to land on Mars and the section of memory that had the tunable control paramters for landing seem to have been affected by high energy cosmic particles that comes form outer space in events like black hole merger, supernove, black hole jets, pulsars' jet. 

You printed out the fixed thrust curve just to check if even that got corrupted or not.
Gladly that's preserved!

Now you're overwritting the control systems using left and the right keys. The control authority is successfully transferred to the keyboard buttons! Command the module to land perfectly upright, without having any angular velocity or any other needless angular or translational momentum!

Now your and the rest of your crew's life depends upon your ability to manually control the thrust vector,
The booster is out of control and the life of astronauts in the is to.
